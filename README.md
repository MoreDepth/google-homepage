### Google Homepage
I just finished building the google homepage replica as my first front-end assignment from [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/html-css).

### Technologies
* HTML
* CSS

### Experience
It took me 3 days to build it out to a satisfactory level. I had to google my way around the definitions of some tags and how to use them - I'm still learning, though. But I have learned a lot!

The **index.html** was pretty easy to write except for a few challenges with the icons, which I removed eventually. However, much of my time was spent on writing out the CSS tags to make the page come alive.

### What I learned...

1. Mastering CSS properties require practice, experimenting and testing your website. For instance, I got to find out the appropriate pixel values for `margin`, `padding`, `borders`, `line-height` and `letter spacing` by trial and error. I need to study further on this area to understand the concepts.

2. Silent properties are powerful (coined the word). 'Silent properties' are those whose effect are not seen after you refresh your webpage.  The `position` property in my CSS file was very instrumental in aligning my footer menus as well as the `bottom` property.

3. My `div`'s should be well-thought out, named properly and easy to track. I know this will come as a keep practicing with more complex projects that will enhance my skills. There is a lot to learn.
